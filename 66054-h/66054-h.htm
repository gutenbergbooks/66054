<span class="firstchar">I</span> want to write about so many things this time that I don’t know where
to begin. At first I had planned to do five or six pages on the crime
of musical criticism in this country—particularly as focused in the critics’
antics with Scriabin’s beautiful <em>Prometheus</em> recently played by the Chicago
Symphony. Truly that was an opportunity for the American music critic!
He could be as righteously bourgeois as he wished and his readers would
credit him with “sanity” and a clear vision; or he could be as ignorantly
facetious as he wished and increase his reputation for wit. It didn’t occur
to him that there might be something wrong with his imagination rather
than with Scriabin’s art. How exciting it would be to find a music critic
whose auditory nerves were as sensitive as his visual or gustatory nerves!
Surely it’s not asking too much of people engaged in the business of sound
that they be able not only to listen but to hear. Well ... there
were many other matters I wanted to write of: For instance, the absurdity
of our music schools; the pest of writers who begin their sentences “But,
however,”; the so-far unnoticed strength of <em>Sanin</em>; the fault with George
Middleton’s <em>Criminals</em>; the antics of the Drama League; the stunning things
in <em>The Egoist</em>; exaggeration as a possible basis of art; the supremacy of
Form; the undefinable standard of those of us who hate standardizations,
etc., etc. But for the moment I have found something more important to
talk about: Mr. Anthony Comstock.
</p>

<p>
Of course there is nothing new to say about him—and nothing awful
enough. The best thing I’ve heard lately is this: “Anthony Comstock not
only doesn’t know anything, but he doesn’t suspect anything.” Francis
Hackett can write about Billy Sunday and resist the temptation of invective.
Perhaps he’s too much an artist to feel the temptation. I wonder if he
could do the same about Anthony Comstock. Certainly I can’t. Even the
thought of Billy Sunday’s mammoth sentimentalizations and the 35,135 people
who, according to the last reports, had been soothed thereby, fills me with
shudders of hopelessness for the eventual education of men. And the thought
of Anthony Comstock is ten times more horrible. His latest outrage is well-known
by this time—his arrest of William Sanger for giving to a Comstock
detective a copy of Mrs. Sanger’s pamphlet, <em>Family Limitation</em>. The charge
was “circulating obscene literature.” I have seen that pamphlet, read it
carefully, and given it to all the people I know well enough to be sure they
are not Comstock detectives. There is not an obscene word in it, naturally.
Margaret Sanger couldn’t be obscene—she’s a gentle, serious, well-informed
woman writing in a way that any high-minded physician might. I have
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
also seen her pamphlet called <em>English Methods of Birth Control</em>, which practically
duplicates the leaflet (<em>Hygienic Methods of Family Limitation</em>)
adopted by the Malthusian League of England and is sent “to all persons
married or about to be married, who apply for it, in all countries of the
world, except to applicants from the United States of America, where the
Postal Laws will not allow of its delivery.” These pamphlets tell in simple
language all the known methods for the prevention of conception—methods
practised everywhere by the educated and the rich and unknown only to
the poor and the ignorant who need such knowledge most. Mrs. Sanger
says in her preface: “Today, in nearly all countries of the world, most
educated people practise some method of limiting their offspring. Educated
people are usually able to discuss at leisure the question of contraceptives
with the professional men and women of their class, and benefit by the
knowledge which science has advanced. The information which this class
obtains is usually clean and harmless. In these same countries, however, there
is a larger number of people who are kept in ignorance of this knowledge:
it is said by physicians who work among these people that as soon as a
woman rises out of the lowest stages of ignorance and poverty, her first
step is to seek information of some practical means to limit her family.
Everywhere the woman of this class seeks for knowledge on this subject.
Seldom can she find it, because the medical profession refuses to give it,
and because she comes in daily contact with those only who are as ignorant
as herself of the subject. The consequence is, she must accept the stray
bits of information given by neighbors, relatives, and friends, gathered from
sources wholly unreliable and uninformed. She is forced to try everything
and take anything, with the result that quackery thrives on her innocence
and ignorance is perpetuated.”
</p>

<p>
The result of this propaganda was Margaret Sanger’s arrest last fall.
I’ve forgotten the various steps by which “that blind, heavy, stupid thing
we call government” came to its lumbering decision that she ought to spend
ten or fifteen years in jail for her efforts to spread this knowledge. But
Mrs. Sanger left the country—thank heaven! However, I understand that
when she has finished her work of making these pamphlets known she means
to come back and face the imprisonment. I pray she doesn’t mean anything
of the kind. Why should she go to jail for ten years because we
haven’t suppressed Anthony Comstock? Last year his literary supervision
was given its first serious jolt when Mitchel Kennerley won the <em>Hagar Revelly</em>
suit. But that was not nearly so important as the present issue, because
<em>Hagar Revelly</em> was rather negative literature and birth control is one of the
milestones by which civilization will measure its progress. The science of
eugenics has always seemed to me fundamentally a sentimentalization—something
that a man might have conceived in the frame of mind Stevenson
was in when he wrote <em>Olalla</em>. Because there is no such thing, really, as
the scientific restriction of love and passion. These things don’t belong in
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
the realm of science any more than one’s reactions to a sunrise do. But
the restriction of the birth-rate does belong there, and science should make
this one of its big battles. Many people who used to believe that love was
only a means to an end, that procreation was the only justification for cohabitation,
now realize that if there is any force in the world that doesn’t
<em>need justification</em> it is love. And these people are the ones who refuse to
bring children into the world unless they can be born free of disease and
stand a chance of being fed and educated and loved. Havelock Ellis sums
it up well: “In order to do away with the need for abortion, and to counteract
the propaganda in its favor, our main reliance must be placed, on the
one hand, on increased foresight in the determination of conception and increased
knowledge of the means for preventing conception; and on the other
hand, on a better provision by the State for the care of pregnant women,
married and unmarried alike, and a practical recognition of the qualified
mother’s claim on society. There can be no doubt that in many a charge
of criminal abortion the real offence lies at the door of those who failed to
exercise their social and professional duty of making known the more natural
and harmless methods for preventing conception, or else by their social
attitude have made the pregnant woman’s position intolerable.”

<p>
But the immediate concern is William Sanger and his trial, which is to
take place some time in April, I believe. His friends are trying to raise
$500 for legal expenses, and contributions may be sent to Leonard D. Abbott,
President of the Free Speech League, 241 East 201st Street, New
York City; to the Sanger Fund, <em>The Masses</em> Publishing Company, 87 Greenwich
Avenue, New York City; to <em>Mother Earth</em>, 20 East 125th Street, New
York City, or to <em>The Little Review</em>.

Another thing that must not be forgotten is the “dramatic” attempt to
blow up St. Patrick’s Cathedral last month, and all the deep plots to destroy
the rich men of that city—what was it the headlines said? Everybody of
normal intelligence who read those headlines suspected a police frame-up—which
it proved to be. The psychology of the police is something I don’t
understand, let alone being able to write about it so that any one else will
understand. So I will quote the story of this quite unbelievable crime—police
crime, I mean—as it appeared in <em>The Masses</em>. (<em>The Masses</em>, by the
way, is one of the magazines indispensable to the living of an intelligent
life). The story is called “Putting One over on Woods”:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
When Commissioner Woods took office as head of the New York police force
a year ago, he brought with him some enlightened ideas about the relation of the
police to the public. A week before a meeting had been held at Union Square
which by police interference had been turned into a bloody riot. A week later
another Union Square meeting took place, with the police under orders to “let
them talk.” The meeting passed off peaceably.
</p>

<p>
Thus the enlightened views of the new commissioner of police were vindicated.
The right of free speech, and of free opinion, was conceded as not being
a menace to civilization.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
But a police force which is enabled to exist and enjoy its peculiar privileges
by virtue of protecting the public against imaginary dangers, could not see its
position undermined in this way. It was necessary to persuade the public that
Socialists, Anarchists, and I. W. W.’s were plotting murder and destruction. The
public was prone to accept this melodramatic view, but Commissioner Woods,
being an intelligent man, was inclined to be cynical. So it became necessary to
“put one over on Woods.”
</p>

<p>
They framed it up in the regular police fashion. A clever young Italian
detective named Pulignano, it appears from the evidence, was promised a raise
of salary and a medal if he would engineer a bomb-plot. Pulignano got hold of
two Italian boys—not anarchists or socialists, but religious fanatics—and urged
them on to blow up St. Patrick’s Cathedral. He planned the deed, bought the
materials of destruction for them, and shamed them when they wanted to pull
out of the plot the night before. The next morning, at great risk to an innocent
public, the bomb was carried into the cathedral, <em>lighted</em>, and then the dozens of
policemen and detectives, disguised as scrubwomen, etc., rushed in to save
civilization.
</p>

<p>
And Woods fell for it. He swallowed the whole sensational business. They
have got him. He is their dupe, and henceforth their faithful tool.
</p>

<p>
Reaction is in the saddle. “All radicals to be expelled from the city,” says
a headline. A card catalogue of I. W. W. sympathizers. Socialism under the
official ban. Free speech doomed.
</p>

<p>
So they hope. At the least it means that the fight has for the lovers of liberty
begun again. But one wonders a little about Arthur Woods. He is on their side
now—the apologist of as infamous and criminal an <em>agent provocateur</em> as ever sent
a foolish boy to the gallows. But will Woods fail to see how he has been used
by the police in this latest attempt to crush freedom in the interest of a privileged
group? Is he as much a fool as they think?
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Giovannitti’s Italian magazine, <em>Il Fuoco</em>, states that the bomb was made
of caps and gravel—the kind of thing children use on the fourth of July.
I know that <em>Mother Earth</em> has started a fund to prevent the two boys from
being railroaded. Will there never be an end of these ghastly things?...

The Poetry of Paul Fort
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Richard Aldington</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is said that there are only three honors in the world really worth accepting.
The first is that of Pope of Rome, the second Prime Minister of
England and the third Prince des Poètes. Monsieur Paul Fort is Prince
des poètes, a sort of unofficial title conferred upon him by the affection and
admiration of the young poets of Paris. Paul Verlaine, Stephen Mallarmé
and Leon Dierx were M. Fort’s successors, and in the ballot which took
place when he was elected M. Henry de Régnier was an excellent second.
</p>

<p>
Paul Fort is indeed a prince of poets, the essence and the type of the
poetic personality, princely in the extraordinary generosity with which he
scatters largess of poetry and princely in his disdain for any occupation but
that of poet. If I were king of England I believe I would ask Paul Fort to
be my Prime Minister, but he would refuse, for he has a better and more
interesting kingdom of his own. He should have been Grand Vizier to
Haroun-al-Raschid, and when the Sultan went to war or to love, when he
was idle or busy, vainglorious or craven, happy or sad, wanton or grave,
M. Fort, Grand Vizier, would have made a poem to express or correct the
Sultan’s mood.
</p>

<p>
Critics are fond of making epigrams on Paul Fort. They say he is
“genius pure and simple”; that he has a nature continually active and awake.
It would be simpler to say he is a poet. Everything he lives, everything he
sees, everything he hears or smells or touches or experiences is matter for
poetry. Everything from Louis XI. to the “joli crottin d’or” goes into his
varied subtle rhythms. He is the only living poet who can gracefully introduce
his own name into a poem without appearing ridiculous. He is continually
interested in himself and notes with pleasure the interest of others:
</p>

<div class="excerpt" lang="fr">
<p class="noindent">
“Cinq, six, sept, huit enfants me suivent très curieux du long nez éclairant la cape
au noir velours, ‘de ce monsieur tombé de la lune, avec des yeux de merlan frit!’ dit
l’un d’entre eux.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
He writes that in the midst of a poem describing a visit to the village of
Coucy-le-Chateau. I have no doubt thousands of other people have been
to Coucy-le-Chateau, among them many poets, but Paul Fort is the first to
make a poem of it:
</p>

<div class="excerpt" lang="fr">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Les sires d’autrefois portaient: <em>Fascé de vair et de gueules.</em> Pour supports: <em>deux lions d’or</em>. Au cimier: <em>un lion issu du même</em>. — Or voici que, premier, notre gai souverain, missire le soleil,</p>
      <p class="verse">porte un écu vivant! “<em>Sur champ de vert gazon</em>, Paul Fort couché près d’une amoureuse Suzon mêle distraitement cent douze violettes à sa barbe, et Suzon rêve sous sa voilette.”</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
There you have the “familiar style” over which so many gallons of ink
have been shed. Observe how perfectly naturally the author speaks of “Paul
Fort”; can you hear Tennyson doing it, or Keats or Francis Thompson
or the disciples of Brunetière? One might make a pleasant little literary
sketch on poets who possess the familiar style to the extent of using their
own names in their verse. Thus, that admirable man, Browning:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">And Robert Browning, you writer of plays,</p>
      <p class="verse">Here’s a subject made to your hand.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And old Walt:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I, Walt Whitman, a Cosmos, turbulent, fleshly, sensual,</p>
      <p class="verse">Eating, drinking and breeding.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
It is, at least, agreeable to find poets who consider themselves as human
beings instead of very inflated, somewhat simian demi-gods. Better a
thousand times have desperate vulgarity than the New England pose au
Longfellow and Emerson, or the still more horrible old England pose au
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Shelley. Heaven preserve me from saying M. Fort
is vulgar, but if to hate pomposity and moral pretentiousness be vulgar,
then let us be vulgar, as M. Fort is. Better be obscene than a ninny.
</p>

<p>
Those who have not read M. Fort’s work and who suspect from the
foregoing quotations that he is really a prose writer impudently palming
off his productions as “sweet poesy,” are asked to read the following poem
with attention:
</p>

<div class="excerpt" lang="fr">
<h3 class="excerpt" id="LARONDE">
LA RONDE

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Si toutes les filles du monde voulaient s’ donner la main, tout autour de la mer</p>
      <p class="verse">elles pourraient faire une ronde.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Si tous les gars du monde voulaient bien êtr’ marins, ils f’raient avec leurs</p>

      <p class="verse">voulaient s’ donner la main.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
That is said, I don’t know with what truth, to be the most popular of
M. Fort’s poems. It certainly was, I am told, in everybody’s mouth in Paris
when it was first published—rather as <em>Dolores</em> was in London in the sixties.
The cadence of the poem is, of course, obvious and marked, as it should be
in a “chanson.” It is rather a good poem to start on, as M. Fort’s way of
printing rhymed and accented verse as prose is there forcibly exemplified.
M. Fort has not abandoned the Alexandrine; but he is not its slave. Confident
in his theory that most poetry is a matter of typography he writes
rhymed alexandrines, rhymed vers libres and rhymed and unrhymed prose
in exactly the same manner; the effect is curious and charming. It is of
course not the very commonplace device of daily newspapers when they
want to be funny, but a genuine artistic principle. The effect is very different
from that received from a perusal of tedious quatrains written as prose;
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
in the latter case one is disgusted immediately, knowing that no man, not
even a paid journalist, is such a fool as to write such stuff in prose; in M.
Fort’s case the typographical arrangement prevents the ear becoming fatigued
with the stressed rhymes of linear verse and at the same time gives a richness
to the apparent prose that no real prose possesses.
</p>

<p>
For example, this quotation from the Roman de Louis XI., one of Paul
Fort’s finest poem-novels.
</p>

<div class="excerpt" lang="fr">
<p class="noindent">
Comtes, barons, chevaliers, capitaines, tous gentilshommes de grand façon, et le
plus fier, le plus grand, le plus beau, Charles de Charolais, qui les dépassait tous,
entrèrent un beau matin d’azur pure et de cloches, dans Rouen, la bonne ville, et
c’était doux plaisir de voir briller les casques, les cuirasses et les housses; les belles
housses, de fin drap d’or étaient, et d’autres de velours, fourrées de pennes d’hermine,
et d’autres de damas, fourrées de zibeline, et d’autres, qui coûtaient moult cher,
d’orfèvrerie; et c’était doux plaisir de voir courir les pages, les beaux jeunes enfants
bien richement vêtus, et le voir danser, devant les personnages, des hommes en sauvages
et de belles femmes nues, et sautiller autour des chevaux, en cadence, des nains rouges,
roses, verts, et des filles en bergère, et de voir flotter aux toits les étandards bleus, semés
de feux d’or, rouges, avec un lion noir, qui se mêlaient avec les bannières toutes blanches,
et de voir venir de la cathédrale, sur le parvis, le clergé violet, venir à la rencontre du
roi Louis le pâle, que représentait un si beau comte, et le ciel bleu passait dans les
clochers à jour, toutes les cloches battaient, de joie ou de douleur, que les crosses
luisaient! que les lances étaient belles!... et c’était doux plaisir d’aller voir les fontaines
jeter vin, hypocras, dont chacun buvait; et y avait encore trois belles sirènes, nues
sur une estrade, comme Ève au paradis, et jouaient d’instruments doux, jolis et graves,
qui rendaient de suaves et grandes mélodies; et c’étaient sur le grand pont, sur la
Seine, écuyers lâchant oisels peints en bleu, et dans toute la ville c’étaient moult plaisances,
dont le tout avait coûté moult finance.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I quote that long passage in full to give a clear notion of M. Fort’s
extraordinary fertility and precision in description. It is better than Hugo’s
descriptions in <em>Notre Dame de Paris</em>, chiefly because it is more natural and
familiar.
</p>

<p>
In this little article I have barely touched the rim of Paul Fort’s work.
He is prodigious; he is not one poet, he is twelve, a whole school of poets;
he is his own disciples, for none dares to imitate him, just as none dares to
imitate Browning. He is the poet who has written everything: Chansons,
Romans, Petites Epopées, Lieds, Elégies, Hymnes, Hymnes Héroiques,
Eglogues et Idylles, Chants Paniques, Poèmes Marins, Odes et Odelettes,
Fantaisies à la Gauloise, Complaintes et Dits, Madrigaux et Romances, Epigrammes
à Moi-même. If he has not written plays, he has been a theater
director, producing work which delighted literary Paris and annoyed the
“boulevardiers”—this at a fabulously early age.
</p>

<p>
It may interest some readers to know what M. Fort has been doing since
the war. He is an inhabitant of Rheims, born opposite the beautiful “cathédrale
assassinée”; and he sits in a room at 125 Boulevard St. Germain writing,
writing, poems against the invading Germans, poems to cheer on his
heroic countrymen, poems mourning friends fallen on the battlefield, poems
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
against H. I. M. the Kaiser, against the Prussian officers, against the “Monstrueux
général baron von Plattenberg” (commanding the army which
bombarded Rheims), poems to the English, to Joffre, and on the Battle of the
Marne. The odd thing is that they are so good. I quote this one, from
national vanity:

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">L</span><span class="postfirstchar">ife</span> and Literature in Russia are interdependent forces to such a degree
that in approaching a phenomenon, whether in book-form or in reality,
we can hardly discern the line of demarcation between cause and effect. If it
is true that a number of Russian writers have mirrored actual life in their
works, it is more significantly true that many powerful authors have influenced
life and have moulded it in accordance with their views and ideas.
And it is to be noticed that the less artistic the writers have been, the more
obvious has been their tendency to preach and sermonize, the stronger their
influence upon the young minds; more than Gogol and Dostoyevsky have
such second-rate writers as Chernyshevsky and Stepnyak succeeded in shaping
the creeds of their readers. We must remember that literature in Russia,
although gagged by bigoted censorship, has been the only medium for
expressing and moulding public opinion throughout the past century, and
to a great extent this holds true to our very day. Revolutionism, terrorism,
socialism, have been propagated through the mouths of novel heroes and
heroines for the ardent emulation of the seeking susceptible youth.
</p>

<p>
The furor produced in Russia by the appearance of Artzibashev’s <em>Sanin</em>
some eight years ago has had no parallel even in that country, where a new
word in belles-lettres has always taken on the significance of a national
event. The importance of this novel is partly due to chronological circumstances—the
fact that it came as a luring will o’ the wisp in the post-revolutionary
gloom of Russian life. The young generation was on the verge
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
of despondency; the collapse of the Revolution brought to nought the long
struggle, the thousands of sacrificed lives, the high aspirations; the Constitution,
which had been the ideal of generations, the religion of all pure-minded
Russia, had degenerated into a mocking buffonade, the subservient
Duma. At such a time Artzibashev steps forward offering the disillusioned
youth a new type—the strong, sane Sanin, who derides the altruistic strivings
of his compatriots and advocates simple animalistic life, sans principles,
sans standards, with the sole aim of satisfying one’s impulses. So
strong and timely was the appeal that it immediately created a large following;
clubs and societies were formed for the promulgation of the new
religion, Sanin’s ideas were hotly discussed from the lecture platform and
in the press—in short, such a formidable movement burst forth that the
government, which has usually welcomed any sign of deviation from revolutionary
thought, became alarmed and withdrew the book from circulation.
</p>

<p>
But the importance of <em>Sanin</em> has been far more than local. In Germany
it was translated and even dramatized, and has created a literature. Even
France, oversatiated with pornography, was for a moment stirred at the
appearance of the sensational novel, until a new scandal captured the limelight.
Finally, with the customary Anglo-Saxon retardation, we have the
book in English.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> The universality of Artzibashev’s appeal is thus evident,
and the question arises: What is the underlying force that makes the book
arouse interest, admiration, and indignation in various tongues and countries?
To my mind, this is the answer: The author, a typical representative
of our age, has performed a purely subjective, introspective study—hence
he has voiced the ideas of his contemporaries, hence he is so readily
understood and appreciated by the children of our civilization.
</p>

<p>
Francis Hackett, who, when he writes on books, has no equal in this
country, has remarked with his usual insight: “It is plain that for himself
Artzibashev has made not a man, but a hero, a god.” To this true statement
I wish to add that when we humans erect a god, we endow him with
those qualities and virtues which we ourselves lack, which to us are but
unattainable desiderata. Artzibashev glorifies Sanin because he himself is
Sanin’s antipode, the whining, impotent Yourii, whom he paints with obvious
disgust. This is no sheer presumption; I have followed the author’s
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
career since his early short stories written in a Tolstoyan, idealistic vein,
where he revealed a restless, self-questioning, self-analyzing spirit of the
sort that he caricaturizes in Yourii: “Perpetual sighing and groaning, or
incessant questionings such as ‘I sneezed just now. Was that the right thing
to do? Will it not cause harm to some one? Have I, in sneezing, fulfilled
my destiny?’” But the idealist-Artzibashev-Yourii lived not in the
clouds, but in the midst of the St. Petersburg Bohème, with the decadent
crowd of the restaurant “Vienna”—a life of questionable virtuousness and
of dubious hygiene. He conceived the idea of <em>Sanin</em> when he had become
almost a physical wreck, forced to spend his time, when not in “Vienna,”
in a resort in Crimea. Incapable of enjoying carnal life any longer, yet
morbidly craving to empty the cup of sensuous pleasures to the dregs, he
creates for himself a fetish, an ideal male, stripped of all human weaknesses,
doubtings, and questionings, free of all principles but the principle
of professing no principles, living to the full the life of a healthy animal.
</p>

<p>
In order to accentuate the superiority of his god, Sanin, the author
surrounds him with sentimental weaklings, vegetating in a small provincial
town, engaged in petty philosophizing and whimpering, bored with one another
and with the general ennui of their life, aimlessly pining, striving
purposelessly. In such a setting the figure of Sanin naturally looms up as
the least boring individual. But try to transfer the hero from this stage of
marionettes into real Russian, or, for that matter, into any life full of
struggle and love and passion, and what a platitudinous, uninteresting figure
he will make! In what he says is nothing strikingly new; his discourses
on Christianity or on morality could have been borrowed from any modern
rank-and-file radical. As to what he does—well, it is zoology. A witty
critic has endeavored to pin to him the label of Superman; what an insult
for our hero, who after a feast of vodka, cucumbers, and cheap cigarettes,
“undressed and got into bed, where he tried to read <em>Thus spake Zarathustra</em>
which he found among Lida’s books” (an interesting detail about the intellectual
status of the provincials who read Ibsen, Hamsun, Nietzsche).
“But the first few pages were enough to irritate him. Such inflated imagery
left him unmoved. He spat, flung the volume aside, and soon fell fast
asleep.”
</p>

<p>
Artzibashev is obviously an erotomaniac. His men and women think of
one another only in sexual terms, dream of possessing and being possessed.
Broad shoulders, strong muscles, intense virility; ample bosoms, swaying
hips, supple bodies—these are the <em>ne plus ultra</em> attractions of his heroes
and heroines. Even nature appears to his characters through a pathological
prism; under the influence of moonlight or sunshine they dream of nude
bodies, white limbs, yielding mates.
</p>

<p>
I repeat my statement: <em>Sanin</em>, or rather Artzibashev, is typical of his
age—the age of the oversatiated enervated urbanite, the age of civilization
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
overdeveloped at the expense of culture. You see them in the big cities
(perhaps to a lesser degree in this young country), on the streets, among
society, among professionals—those over-ripe men and women whose senses
have become dull, who are driven by ennui and imbecility to seek the piquant,
the bestial, the “healthy.” But the true healthy men and women do not talk
health, sex, muscles, virility, for as long as our natural faculties are sound
we are hardly aware of them. The healthy, those who are pulsating with
life, strive to surpass themselves, strive towards the Superman; it is the
pathological, the incapacitated, the withered, who impotently yearn for a
retrogradation towards the Subman-Sanin.

cosmopolitan transliteration of the proper names and the numerous nonsensical

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> moment seems due. Fashion had better take care. Beggars can spit
very venomously. Weird-looking jumbles of bones in rags are leering
and grinning, jostling and hustling very defiantly. Men are blowing their
noses on doorsteps and wearing their hats in church. Hunger is no more
passive. Time comes, and with it the fulfillment of every destiny prophesied
by a fact. Hunger is sickly till Frenzy quickens it. Hunger has no brain,
and does not consider. It curses and swears, is blear-eyed and croaks.
It sneers, mocks, jeers, coughs. It spits and throws filth on fine linen. It
pours out from cesspool haunts and stinks out the most respectable of
neighborhoods. Hunger has no morality—is devoid of all shame. In
highest moods hungry knaves will hurl stones, smash windows, pinch, eat,
drink, tear down altars, stretch the necks of the Respectable between the
head and the shoulders, use guns, laugh, grin, joke, mock, stick grass in
mouths of their victims, use pikes, uproot bastiles, and without ceremony
lop off heads with every consecutive second of the clock. Hunger startles
the world from its slumber, with a shock. Beware, Friends! Hunger is
lynx-eyed and sees behind every fact. It sniffs and can smell out anything
suspicious. Hunger will hurt no man except he smell or look a little of
Tyranny. Does Tyranny wear a powdered wig, talk good French and say
“Monsieur”—Hunger looks, sniffs, finds it, and sends its head rolling
into a bushel basket. Does it look like a New York banker, have crease in
pants, talk grammatical English, wear gold chain, wipe nose with clean
handkerchief, wear feathered plumes and fashionable gowns—Hunger noses
it out and despatches it without delay. Respectability with its disdain;
Education with its stupidity; Fashion with its vanity; Wealth with its
luxury; all exhale the same odor to the sniffings of Hunger. When Hunger
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
sniffs, it is time for Fashion to drape itself in rags and give to its body
a smell of dung. If Hunger cannot taste food, it will drink blood. There
is only one passion stronger than Love—Hatred. Love will Sacrifice, but
Hatred will live, though it torture the world with all the machinations of
hell. Hatred and Hunger are dogs of the same kennel....
Hunger Hounds, starved, snarling, bloodshot eyes, fangs bared, straining
at their chains—Friends, Beware!... Hunger—lean, bony,
naked, and grimy—with talons and claws. Hunger with fever and mad.
Hunger goaded. Hunger grinning. Hunger in consort with Death. Hunger—hideous,
impalpable. Hunger that cannot die. Hunger, blood-smeared,
ghastly, and sallow, with rotting teeth. Hunger that spits and leers. Hunger—devilish
nightmare to all Tyrannies. Hunger, the fiendish torment of
all Fashions and Respectabilities. Hunger without Reason—mad and demoniac.
Hunger! Hunger! Hunger! Hunger! Friends, Beware! The
moment seems due. Time will fulfill the destiny of a Fact.

<span class="firstchar">D</span><span class="postfirstchar">espite</span> its two world-cities our America is still a vast unattached province,
subject now to the influence of London, now to that of Berlin or
Paris, and again in a period of disaffection and unrestraint. Our taste is
childish,—a capricious, intermittent taste—good once in a while, never lasting,
and by no means frequent. Such a taste gives a few pleasures but not
the developed one of judgment. It never lasts long enough to be imposed.
We are unable to pair two congenial traditions and get a tendency. There
is nothing for it but to welcome another generation of incomprehensible
foreigners in the hope that among them will be found a mate for our very
real desire for fine things.
</p>

<p>
One country has sent us little inspiration. Her natives do not willingly
leave her soft sky for our harsh brilliant western sun. They have a proverbial
preference for her gentle manner and speech. For our youth she has
the admiration and envy of age, for our red knuckles and large ankles she
has the indulgence of one who has been beautiful for many lovers, but for
our loud-mouthed demand for adulation she has the aloofness of one who has
still many courtiers. If we go fearfully as befits our youth and humbly as
befits our awkwardness to Paris, instead of waiting for Paris the beautiful
to come to us, perhaps we shall receive what Berlin and London have not
yet given us.
</p>

<p>
London came to us willingly with a scholarly something that was better
than our previous nothing. Berlin forced on us a manner of strong professionalism
that was better than our previous weakness. Now we are beyond
the age of facile conquests and we must, at the risk of being rebuffed and
made unhappy, seek the favor of a lady who stays at home.
</p>

<p>
Since the spirit of Mozart and Beethoven and Schubert left Vienna,
Music has loved no city. We shall soon agree that she did not love Weimar
greatly nor Munich at all nor Leipzig enough. As for the lusty person
who flaunts a passion for Berlin, we must call her a maid masquerading
in her mistress’s cloak if, indeed, we concede her a resemblance to music
at all.
</p>

<p>
The joy of loveliness admired, the frankness and naivete, the “jeu perle”
and natural melodiousness that were the life of Viennese Music vanished
utterly with the death of Schubert unknown. It seemed that he and his
predecessors must have brought music into a cul-de-sac from which it would
have to extricate itself. German music did and received new impetus from
the professionalism of Weber, the literary romanticism of Liszt, the savoir-vivre
of Chopin, and the cosmicality of Wagner. France, meanwhile, entertained
loyally the older manner, nursing it through its unpopularity into the
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
convalescence it now enjoys. When we come to discover that the spirit of
Berlin is rather of something hyphenated to “Kultur” than of music purely,
we shall also discover the spirit of Vienna,—vigorous and slightly Frenchified,
in the Conservatoire and the Schola Cantorum.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, without the least effort or merit, we have strolled into the
position of the “distinguished amateur.” It is an eminence from which one
may see everything if one but keep a clear eye and a doubting mind. What
fools we should be to view the road before us as we can only this once, wearing
a prejudice like a pair of smoked goggles. To doubt is a privilege which
the wise will make a duty. We should doubt what has given us our artistic
existence, and if it can only stand by our faith it will fall—but we shall not
fall with it. We should doubt the things we desire so that when we abandon
them we cannot be reproached with broken faith. We <em>must</em> doubt the
strength of organized professionalism that Berlin would teach us, the value
of hard work the contrapunctalists of the Royal Academy preach;—we <em>must</em>
doubt the superiority of art and the artist, the inviolability of tradition, the
legitimacy of the Beethoven-Wagner-Strauss succession for the reason that
they have been so freely offered if for no other. Surely such eagerness to
be accepted does not prove great worth. Let us pooh-pooh all these magnificent
“Pooh-Bahs” of music to see if their threats to have our heads off are
real or bluff. Then with our tongues still in our cheeks, let us continue on to
other courts.
</p>

<p>
If we have enjoyed the simple and fine art with which Beethoven and
Schubert enlivened and refined the salons of Vienna, we shall enjoy Franck.
If we should prefer our Mozart livelier by a notch of the metronome and
lighter by one-half of the strings than we hear it now, we should be pleased
by Chabrier and Faure and the way they are played by the half-dozen youngsters
who get their premier prix at the end of each year’s work in the Conservatoire.
From pure inertia we have out-stayed our pleasure in modern
German music. A bit of animation and on to Paris!

ex-critic, of the daily papers. That this gathering is unique is attested by
numerous hushed conversations at other tables; the critics’ table is a center
of half-concealed interest. A waiter has just cleared away the dishes; cigars

know anything, and I do, this Shanks is going to become <em>the</em> American
composer. Why, he’s so much better than MacDowell with all his Scotchy
junk that there’s no comparison. I found Shanks in Rolling Prairie, South
Dakota; and when I play his <em>March of the Rock-Spirits</em> at my recital on

<p>

Debussy never does anything but move up and down the whole-tone scale;
no melody, no counterpoint, no music at all. And take the Tchaikowsky
thing, for instance. Everybody knows that Tchaikowsky always carried a
whip in one hand and a gun in the other, and when he wasn’t using one, it
was the other. It’s proverbial, and makes such a handy remark when thinking
would take too long. And his piano-style: he simply hasn’t got any; it’s
pathetic. I see you don’t get my joke on the sixth symphony—the Pathetique.
I say, America won’t stand for that sort of thing. Some kindly person should
have informed this Madame Frizza Bonjoline before she made a complete
fool of herself.

No further imbecility is displayed for the time being. Soon the party
breaks up, and a natural modesty prevents the critics from seeing each other
again until after the piano recital by Madame Frizza Bonjoline, an artist who
is but slightly known in the United States, but one who has achieved recognition
throughout Europe, South America, and Australia. She has just
given an unusual program, which she could not close with less than seven
encores. While the five critics wait outside the green-room, they hold a
restrained conversation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett to Krupp.</span> It’s good to have you among us again, Krupp.
Although I do have a terrible time steering my thoughts through the mazes
of the English language I feel like the only live one left, since the Trib
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
dropped you. The town needs you, and I’m glad you have an opportunity
again to mould public opinion. We need more strong-minded men like you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp</span> (<span class="dir">fiercely</span>). I know it, but the cattle don’t recognize good criticism
when they see it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett to Krupp.</span> How did the Madame strike you? Plenty of
emotion, I thought.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp</span> (<span class="dir">to all</span>). Impossible program—good God!—did you ever hear
such a medley? And she hasn’t the strength of a kitten.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett to Krupp.</span> Of course, she didn’t seem quite vital enough, but
that may have been because of her choice of numbers. They were somewhat
“outre.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp</span> (<span class="dir">sourly</span>). Altogether too girlish, I say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Splendid personality, but a rotten technic, don’t you
think?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> As near as I can tell, she wears marvelous silk
hose. They were the most striking thing about the whole concert.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> Blgh-ggh-h!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Xilef Bowowski.</span> I suppose then, Mr. Worcester, one doesn’t require
any ears to get the good or bad out of a concert—only eyes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Well, Bowowski, ears were a nuisance today, at
any rate, don’t you think? The optic impressions were far the best—easily.
I wonder when we’re going to get in here.
</p>

<p class="dir">
Xilef Bowowski has been tramping up and down the corridor, his ultra-distinguished
chin a trifle elevated, his hands locked behind his back. He is
evidently searching for words. In a moment, the door of the green-room
swings open and a well-dressed man is seen bidding good-bye to Madame
Frizza. The stranger takes no notice of the group of critics as he brushes
past and hurries away. Then a most charming voice welcomes the five critics.
The Madame is greeted by four blushes and one scowl. The scowling one,
Mr. Krupp, is the first one to enter the green-room. Close behind him
come the embarrassed four.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> Gentlemen, this is so good of you. And how did
you like my recital? I hope it pleased you—yes?
</p>

<p class="dir">
There is a moment of silence which, as it becomes awkward, is broken by
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Some concert, all right.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> How good of you. I am happy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> I confess I find myself unable to understand the
judgment which places Debussy at the first of a program. Now why did
you——
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> Ah,—ho, ho, ha, ha—that is our little joke, gentlemen,
is it not? I suppose no one knew that I played Rachmaninoff
instead of Debussy at the start—no one but ourselves. I changed my mind
after I was out on the platform.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> I was—blgh-h!—that is, Mr. Stalk was at my
office to see me about my coming American orchestra concert, at which I
myself conduct, and so I was detained, and did not get to hear your opening
number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> How did you manage to get along without
Brahms, Madame. I should be interested——
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> Oh, you did not hear my third encore, then—the
Brahms B-minor Capriccio. I am so sorry you missed it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Oh, was that Brahms? I thought it sounded rather
chunky, now that I recall it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Would it seem too—well, let us say—American to
you if I were to ask you to lunch with me, Madame Bonjoline? I should be
extremely happy to have that pleasure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> Ah, but the pleasure is mine. I shall be delighted
to accept—that is, if there is time. I make that condition only.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Thank you, thank you, Madame.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Xilef Bowowski.</span> Madame Bonjoline, do you remember the date of
publication of the Gliere Prelude which you played today? It has completely
slipped my mind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame</span> (<span class="dir">laughing</span>). My good sir, I could not recall it to save my
soul.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> I wish your playing sounded as good as it looks,
Madame.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> How delightfully American you are! So frank,
so utterly frank! But that reminds me: my friend, James Shooneker—perhaps
you saw him; he left just as you came in—told me that my playing
looked as good as it sounded. How strange a coincidence! You all know
him, of course. For Europe, he is the great critic. He is in Chicago for
a short time, and he is going to review my recital for a magazine here—I
believe it is called <em>Le Petit Revue</em>, or something like that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> Oh, yes; that effusive young lady’s journal,
<em>The Little Review</em>. I have heard of it. Ha!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Their poor musical writer was in your audience
this afternoon, Madame.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> He’s one of those chaps you can meet three
or four times and still never recognize on the street.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> So? At any rate, James Shooneker is going
to “write up” (I believe you say) my recital. I understand that this number
of <em>The Little Review</em> is coming from the press in the morning, and his article
will appear in it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Carbon Hatchett.</span> So, indeed. This Mr. Shooneker, if I remember
correctly, has written a book—what is the title of it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> Och! He has written so many, many books!
I do not know which one you mean.
</p>

<p class="dir">
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
The charms of the woman, her little moues, smiles, and quick gestures,
are entangling the five men. Conversation becomes increasingly difficult.
The writers leave the green-room and, on the outside with the door closed,
they glance nervously at one another.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Say: this James Shooneker,—who’s he?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> Who cares who he is? His stuff won’t get
far in that sheet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Edward Morless.</span> Of course not. I just wondered. For my part,
I’ve had a terrible afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> But Ed, think of tonight. You’ve got to listen
to Walter Spratt’s piano-playing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Carbon Hatchett.</span> Do you call that playing?
</p>

<p class="dir">
Nothing seems to relieve the collective nervousness of the five judges.
At the outer door, they separate. Ben Dullard Krupp makes his way to
McChug’s book-store and, after one swift glance up the street and another
down the street, he pushes strenuously through the whirling doors. With
swinging tread, he marches down the broad center aisle and hails a busy clerk.
Yes, the clerk has sometimes heard of James Shooneker and—yes,—they
have a book or two of his—just a minute. Then a convulsive terror seizes
Ben Dullard Krupp, for on the other side of the same counter stands Donald
Worcester. The younger approaches the elder with unaccustomed familiarity,
having him, at the moment, on the hip, as it were.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Looking up Shooneker? Here’s one of his
things,—<em>Half-tones in Modern Music</em>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> Oh, yes; that. I remember reading it when
I was scarcely more than a boy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> It was published in 1909, I see.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Ben Dullard Krupp.</span> Must be a later edition, then. Oh, pshaw!
What’s the use of waiting for that clerk? I think I have a complete set
of Shooneker packed away at home.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> That so? Well, I’ll tell the clerk you couldn’t
wait. Maybe I’d like the book myself, if it’s worth anything at all.
</p>

<p class="dir">
The presence in Chicago of one James Shooneker is like some fearfully
disturbing shadow behind each of the five writers. Bowowski, within half
an hour after the recital, has three helpers in the Public Library searching
for every printed word of Shooneker. After a tasteless dinner, Ben Dullard
Krupp scares three piano pupils out of their wits by an unusual amount of
shouting and stamping; this, also, should be attributed to the visiting author.
Worcester seeks his desk in the editorial room and crams on “Pathetic
Spaces”—Shooneker’s latest book, according to the clerk. But the young
critic’s attention strays from the pages of print to the lady in the green-room
... lovely person, if she can’t play the piano. Worcester
has an impulse to use the telephone, and soon it masters him. He calls
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
up Madame Bonjoline’s hotel and, as she is out, leaves a message—he will
call in person at eight o’clock. Then a note is written, which he despatches
to her by messenger. After that, there is time to think things over. Was
there ever anyone as charming as she? And she has expressed her admiration
for his frank manner and open criticism. Perhaps——Now
the Madame is not willing to admit him at first; but he is insistent, and
she permits him to enter. James Shooneker is seated by the window. Worcester,
like a guilty boy, shakes hands with him and mumbles acknowledgement.
But soon the celebrated critic has him at his ease, and the young
journalist is talking with his accustomed candor. Then, continuing in the
same friendly manner,
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> Mr. Worcester, you might be interested in knowing
the reason for my Chicago visit. In fact, it is only fair you should know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Sure!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> Very well then. Your paper, the Worst Glaring
Nuisance, as its catch-word has it, has sent for me to fill the vacancy created
by your resignation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Who’s bluff is this?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> It is true. I have your place offered me. Now,
I don’t want to seem arbitrary, but here’s my proposition: In the first place,
cut out your infatuation for Madame Bonjoline. That’s the main condition,
if you want me to leave Chicago. The second thing is perhaps more important
to yourself, and that is that you promise to take a long course in
counterpoint and musical history under some good authority, if you can
find one in the United States. Perhaps you would do well to tap the boundless
information of your friend, Bowowski. These are my only demands.
I don’t want your job. I’ll drop a note to your editor and tell him he doesn’t
appreciate you. But you will have to forget your aspirations for the Madame,
and behave yourself with a dignity becoming your position. You mustn’t
make yourself ridiculous over Frizza, and for her sake—
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Shooneker, you certainly are a brick! You
certainly are! I can’t help being a bit dazed with Madame, but I’ll keep it
all to myself. You’re a peach!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> See, James, how perfectly American he is! I
told you he would be. Isn’t he a dear boy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> You like the conditions, then?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Bully! I appreciate them. And say, didn’t you
write a book once called <em>The Insane Melons</em>?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> Yes, I have a book with a title something like
that. Why do you ask?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> If you’ve got one with you, I’d like a signed
copy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">James Shooneker.</span> I’m very sorry, but I didn’t bring any with me.
Perhaps I can send you one later.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
<span class="character">Donald Worcester.</span> Fine! I wish you would. That’s treating me
mighty good.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Madame Bonjoline.</span> You deserve it, my boy.
</p>

<p class="dir">
In a confusion of thanks, apologies, and compliments, Worcester leaves
the room and returns to the office, where an article is written which harbors
no doubt that Madame Frizza is a great pianist. About the same hour, Mr.
Morless is passing in a copy of his own criticism, stating that the Madame
is a fairly promising amateur. The menacing cloud of Shooneker seems to
hang over him; it has nearly prevented his passing in the article. And
Ben Dullard Krupp, without a regular post, mails his lengthy and scathing
opinion of the Madame to a weekly paper, in the hope of securing a steady
allotment of their space. To him, also, the thought of an “outside” critic in
their midst is irritating and, at times, threatening. What was HE going to
say about her? His word might have weight. Suppose ... and
Krupp wishes now he could reach into the mail-box and pull out his article.
But the panic passes; he recalls several of his pet phrases, and this restores
full confidence in his own finality.
</p>

<p class="dir">
Again—the same dining-room in the “Cave Dwellers,” with three of
the critics disposing of an early lunch, almost early enough to be called
breakfast.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Bowowski.</span> They can’t print more than a couple hundred.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett.</span> Somebody told me they had several thousand paid subscriptions,
and then printed a bunch of extras.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> What difference does that make? The point is: what will
they sell for? I’m good for my share, but there’s a limit, you know. Do
you suppose that if I offered to do their musical criticism, they would destroy
this issue as it stands?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett.</span> You can’t tell. It isn’t “they” but “she.” You’re dealing
with a woman, a young one at that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> Oh, Hell; I can get around that difficulty. Waiter! Bring
me a telephone! Hurry up!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Bowowski.</span> Do you realize, gentlemen, that it is more than possible,
in fact it is even likely, considerably more than probable, that we are right
in the case of Madame Bonjoline, and that one James Shooneker is in
error?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett.</span> By George! That’s so, isn’t it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> There’s no question about it. Just wait a minute now, while
I call up this “Little Revolt”—ha! ha!—and see how they jump at the mention
of my name.
</p>

<p class="dir">
Ben Dullard Krupp is informed over the wire that the new issue of<em>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> </em>in large quantities is already in the mails, etc. In
fact, at the same moment, the famous Shooneker is glancing through his
own contribution; he swears at a misprint and puts the magazine in his
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
suitcase, to read on the train. Madame Bonjoline does not open her copy,
having read the article concerning herself from manuscript, two weeks before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> Rank insolence, I call it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett.</span> What’s the matter? Won’t they sell?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> She says the mails are flooded with the impudent sheet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Bowowski.</span> Horrible! Horrible, indeed!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> It’s a great pity somebody couldn’t loosen up and say something
about this Shooneker. How did I know who he was, or that his
opinion was worth anything? Fine chance I’ll have now of getting on The
Saturday Blade!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Bowowski.</span> Perhaps if you had been able to curb your unfounded
hatred of Tchaikowsky for a moment, we wouldn’t have been placed in this
ridiculous position.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> Blgh-gg-h! It’s bad music, rotten! and I don’t care who
knows I said it. This country is simply spineless when it comes to having
an opinion about music. Why, I’ve got enough opinion to supply the nation,
and they need it. That’s why I put on my American concerts. They’ve
got to learn that I’m the only prophet in America’s musical future. I feel
that it’s my duty—
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Hatchett.</span> Tchaikowsky has written some very good—
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Krupp.</span> Tchaikowsky! Man! if you mention that mediocrity’s unhallowed
name again, I’ll go completely mad!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">Bowowski.</span> Great Heavens! Tim is coming to put us out, just on
account of your infernal shouting. And look! With him! Shooneker!
How perfectly horrible!

Abashed and silent, the three judges leave the table and get into their
coats with more celerity than is comfortable. They glimpse a faint smile on
the face of their jinx as they hasten out. The waiter, Tim, conceals his
own mirth. Two critics rush down the street without a word. Calling

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">ad</span> Mme. Strindberg deliberately planned to revenge herself upon him
who was once her husband, she could have devised no subtler way
of wounding that redoubtable sham-hater than the manner in which she
chose to speak of him before the Chicago public. As I sat in the prickly
darkness, with its accompanying rumble of Beethoven, I half-expected the
musty atmosphere of legerdemain to be scattered by the great August’s
derisive laughter. But the promise of occult things was not fulfilled, for
with the cessation of the music came a rosy glow, and then a gracious lady
with a wistful presence. And she seemed quite at ease in her mise en scène.
</p>

<p>
She read to us of herself, of Prince Hassan’s feast in Paris, of her
theatrical meeting with Strindberg, and of how he talked with her all the
evening and later walked home with her; of how she stopped on the bridge
to toss snowballs and Strindberg dried her hands upon his handkerchief; and
of how she dreamed of him that memorable night—a strange symbolic
dream. And as she read, her face was as quiet water rippled by gentle
vagrant breezes.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the meeting was distinguished by the fact that there
was light, but the spirit of the seance persisted. Madame pleaded for questions,
but the little audience seemed frozen into inarticulateness. Those few
who did venture stammered for a moment and then drooped into silence.
Madame, however, was not discouraged. She read us Strindberg’s views
on divorce. In reply to the mumbled questions she replied that she considered
eugenics impractical and indelicate, that her husband had believed
intensely in peace and had written a beautiful story in its favor, which she
had meant to read us but to which an accident had occurred; that Strindberg
was a democrat in theory but an aristocrat in feeling; that he was not a
misogynist, but had reviled bad women because he loved good women; that
<em>The Father</em> was a plea for the sanctity of the home, the sanctity of woman....
Until it seemed that she was not speaking of the bitter-tongued,
fiery-souled Swede, but of some complacent American, say, Augustus
Thomas. And then someone said that it was past ten, and Madame thanked
us and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
As we swung down Michigan Avenue in the fresh night air I smiled to
think that over across the water they still thought of us as the “hayseed”
among the nations to whom the “gold brick” might be disposed with impunity—and
with exceeding profit. But we are learning....

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> common with all the judicious readers of American magazines and
newspapers, I have learned to look on the advertising pages for the best
examples of news the journalist can offer. It is only reasonable that this
should be the case. Advertisement writers are the best-paid, least rewarded,
and best-trained authors that America possesses. Compared to these, even
the income of a Robert Chambers pales into insignificance. Moreover, they
understand the public thoroughly and do not attempt to overstrain its attention
by overseriousness, or exhaust its nerves by sentimentality. That is, the
best ones do not. There may be some exceptions, but in the main I have
found American advertisements refreshingly readable.
</p>

<p>
It had never occurred to me, however, that there might be gems of
poetic ability hidden away in these tantalizing concoctions—these cocktails
of prose. But I must revise my estimate. Without wishing to boom or discourage
anyone’s products I cannot resist quoting some recent advertisements
that I and I alone have discovered, seized, and gloated upon. After
all, I approach the subject purely from the angle of form. What student
of poetic form could afford to ignore the following:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<h3 class="excerpt" id="SERVEAHOTMUFFINSUPPER">
SERVE A HOT MUFFIN SUPPER
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Light flaky muffins, <em>oven hot</em> and <em>golden topped</em>, a suppertime goody that certainly
will strike that hungry <em>spot</em>. Serve them with the finest, richest syrup you can buy
anywhere. That’s “Velva,” with the best of flavor, nourishing goodness and the
satisfying elements that put real strength into growing children. Give them Velva
three times a <em>day</em>. They’ll say, “<em>Great</em>,” when they eat it on your <em>flaky</em> hot biscuits or
on <em>waffles</em> or <em>batter cakes</em>.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I hope the unknown author of this little masterpiece will excuse my
italics. The public simply will not see beauties that are not pushed under
its nose. If the public could realize how much more difficult as well as more
musical this style of writing, with its rich assonances and rhymes on <em>day</em>,
<em>say</em>, <em>great</em>, <em>flaky</em>, <em>cakes</em>, is, than the insipid tinklings of the lyrists who feebly
strum in pathetically threadbare metres through the pages of most magazines,
then we would have a revolution in verse-writing. That we have not yet
arrived at the revolution is proved by the fact that a talent of this order confines
itself to writing syrup advertisements.

I do not say this is without faults. With the substance I have, naturally,
nothing to do. But as regards form, which of your scribblers of cosmic
bathos and “uplift stuff” could more cunningly weave <em>pipe</em>, <em>ice</em>, <em>life</em>, <em>strike</em>,
and <em>time</em> into a stanza that has half as much swing and verve, as this? Note
also the absence of adjectives. In short, here is poetry with a “punch” to it.

When the curtain rises the nurse is straightening and tucking in with
uncomfortable tightness the white counterpane of the bed. On the bed, with
eyes closed, lies what is left of a girl of 18 or 20. The nurse takes the thermometer
from the girl’s mouth, looks at it, shakes her head and makes
a record note on the chart. She gives the girl water to drink and leaves her
with a final pull to straighten the bed clothes. The girl tosses restlessly—moans
a little and impatiently kicks at and pulls the bed clothes out at the

Marianna Lane swung back and forth, back and forth, in the hammock,
tapping her small, brown toe on the porch as she swung. It was a
charming porch, framed in clematis and woodbine, but Marianna had no
eye for its good points. She was lying with two slim arms clasped behind
her head, staring vacantly up at the ceiling and composing a poem. On the
wicker table beside her stood a glass of malted milk and a teaspoon. They
were not the subject of the poem, but they were nevertheless responsible for
it. In the first place, Marianna would <em>not</em> drink her twelve-o’clock malted
milk, and as she was forbidden to go off the porch until she had done so,
there seemed to be nothing better to do than to cultivate the muse in the
hammock. After patiently sipping malted milk for eight years, Marianna
had suddenly rebelled. In the second place, her cousin Frank, who lived in
the next house, had been inspired by this beverage to make up an insulting
ditty.

he sang loudly over the hedge whenever he <a id="corr-24"></a>caught sight of Marianna’s middy
blouse and yellow pigtails. That was yesterday. To-day the malted milk
was standing untouched upon the wicker table, and Marianna in the hammock
was trying to think up an offensive rhyme for Frank. When she found
it, she intended to go around on the other side of the house and shout it as
loud as ever she could in the direction of her uncle’s garden. This, it is true,
was a tame revenge. What Marianna really wanted to do was to go over
and pinch her cousin Frank; but that, unhappily, was out of the question,
as Frank had a cold, and she was strictly forbidden to go near anybody
with a cold.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> No, not tomorrow. Perhaps in a month, perhaps longer.

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Will I get sorry ’fore I go?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> How can I tell? But what does it matter? Why do

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> What you sayin’?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> You and I can believe differently if we want to. But
why in the world should you be asking me all these hard questions? I’ve
never been to Heaven have I? I don’t know whether you have to be sorry
to get in or not. How do you suppose <em>they</em> found all that out?

<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>

so bad?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Yep.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> And I told you you would have to bear it, that I could
do nothing for you, and that you must be quiet not to disturb the others?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Oh, don’t I remember!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> I guess that’s about enough punishment for one little
girl. You’ve been pretty unhappy lately, haven’t you, with the pain and
the terrible thoughts? I think it’s about time something else turned up
for you that would be nicer, don’t you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Turned up?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> Yes, something that would make up for all this. Do
you know, child, as I’ve gone through these wards day after day ’tending
to all you sick folks, I’ve about come to the conclusion that there must be—something
nicer—
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Tell me more about it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> Well now—there’s another queer question. Didn’t I
tell you I don’t know anything to tell? I’ve never been there. I should
think <em>you</em> would have found out a <em>little</em> something since you’re planning to
go so soon. But no, I don’t suppose you know much more than the rest
of us. And when you get there you will probably forget all about me and
how much I’d like to know what’s happening to my little patient. No use
I suppose asking you to tie a red string on your finger and say “that’s to
send Dr. Carroll a little message.” Is there any way, do you think you
could remember?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> You’re kiddin’ me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> Indeed I am not. I long to know with all my heart,
and I suppose it will be years and years before I do. Why just think, you,
you are going to have a great adventure—You are going on a journey to
a far country where you’ll find out lots of things, and here am I, jogging
along up and down, to and fro, between my office and this hospital and
wondering and wondering and wondering! What a lucky little girl you are!
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> And I don’t have to be sorry—to get in?
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Doctor.</span> Didn’t I tell you you were going soon anyway? You
can be sorry if you want to—but I think it is more interesting to dream
about the strange things there will be to discover, at the end of the journey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="character">The Girl.</span> Will there be gates of gold that open wide, and angels
standin’ by with shinin’ wings?
</p>

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> history of the world has not known a greater movement than that
which seized the hearts of men when the old culture was borne to its
grave, <em>and a new fresh Spring-life,—the Christ-life</em>, as it came to be called,—of
humanity, welled up from hidden and mysterious sources of power.
In the commerce of thought diverse folk-spirits were cross-fertilized and
bounds once held to be insurmountable were transcended as vision grew
wider. Customs came to be more human. Man himself grew greater,
deeper, freer. Man learned to practice virtues which hitherto he had hated
as vices: mercifulness, meekness, peaceableness. Man prayed to a new
God who made his sun to shine upon the evil and the good. He ever
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
created sacreder names for his God. Taking his cue from the adorable
will of this new God he framed ever more earnest and more sacred rules
of life. These were radical and revolutionary novelties to the old culture,
which speedily scented the dangers menacing it, and as speedily dispatched
executioners to the rescue. In the language of its old theology, the language
of St. Augustine, this was called the war of the Kingdom of the World
against the Kingdom of God. Any well-informed scholar can recall what
were said to be the hindrances which the Kingdom of God had at first to
overcome, and how today these hindrances still offer the same resistance;
degenerate paganism, with its powers of unbelief, and with its supremacy
of the “flesh”; judaism, apostate from God, with its priests and scribes.
</p>

<p>
It is not within the scope of my task to inquire how far this traditional
<em>schema</em> of the upheavals at the tumultuous beginnings of our era coincide
with the facts. Only one consideration concerns me at this time, and that
one is not open to question: change as the phenomena of history may, the
<em>laws</em> of those phenomena remain ever the same. Accordingly, even the
resistances which time’s new unfolding life has to surmount, ever return—usually
under a changed name, indeed,—and they will continue to do so
as long as there is a history of human culture in the life of the world.
</p>

<p>
Passing on, now, to speak of the forces which the most modern prophet
of a new culture, <em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em>, looks upon as the most grievous
hindrances to a <em>new kind of man</em>, we shall surely expect to see first of all,
quite other faces than those which the pious fathers of the old church saw
in the foes of the <em>civitas die</em>; still, we shall re-discover, significantly enough,
many an old acquaintance behind the strange re-modeled mask. As in that
old day, so in ours, we shall perceive in these foes of a new life, nothing
of their hostility to life. In part, they appear quite harmless; in part, they
are the universally dined and wined celebrities of the day at whom the
masses stare as the special pioneers of our culture, and in whom the masses
applaud the bearers and promoters of the best achievements of our culture.
It would be certainly a very one-sided and unhistorical way of looking at
things were we to hold those particular individuals, who did duty in the
olden days in synagogues of the scribe’s learning, primarily responsible for
the warfare which ancient Christianity had to sustain against the dominant
religious parties, especially against the scribes and their followers.
The war was not waged against <em>persons</em>, but against a <em>system</em>. The synagogue
was the <em>school</em> of the Jews; the scribes were the <em>masters</em> in that
school. Viewed from this side, Christianity seemed to be rebellion against
the authority of the school, and an emancipation of humanity from the
influence which the toasted masters of the school exercised over spirits.
</p>

<p>
Approaching the problem, then, as to how far such an emancipation
would be serviceable today, one need scarcely say that one does not at all
have in mind the institutions which, in a narrower sense, we now have
come to call “schools.” As, for broad gauge philosophers, the concept
priesthood is by no means identical with a definite office, the so-called
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
clerical office, so what we understand by school and its masters, in Nietzsche’s
sense, embraces a much wider circle than we are wont to think. There are
schoolmasters in all vocations and callings and positions, not alone among
scholars, but also among artists, politicians, laborers and merchants. We
find them in the household and in the nursery; for schoolmaster-ism is a
<em>certain kind of spirit</em>, and it is this kind of spirit which, under various
names, Nietzsche pursues with his bitterest scorn and ridicule; which he
stigmatizes as the most perilous hindrance in the path of the new culture.
</p>

<p>
We modern men must concede that Nietzsche is right at this point;
that mastery on the part of “school” signifies decay, stuntedness, of the
very human essence itself.
</p>

<p>
School gives <em>knowledge</em>. In all knowledge, man confronts nature.
Man elaborates nature in his thoughts, and thus lifts himself <em>above</em> nature.
With his rules, he becomes master of nature. But, now, if a man abides
in his school, a time comes, irremediably, when he is estranged from nature,
estranged from life. His knowledge grows, indeed, his world of thought
enlarges; but the “thoughts” which he calls his “knowledge” narrow and
cramp him! The more he learns to work exclusively with his thoughts,
the more he mislearns whence he derives his thoughts. He thinks about
things, but he no longer finds his way into things, right into the innermost
life of things. He thinks <em>after</em>, not <em>with</em>, not before. He thinks the alien,
not his own. He knows names, not souls. Yes, life is so great, so infinite;
and the school, our knowledge of life, is so paltry, so limited! Once man
stood with his soul in this big wide world. Intimations of its abysses, unfathomable
and awful, haunted him. Once man felt his hot cheeks fanned
by the breezes of an eternal life of the world, by a divine breath that
breathed and blew through the world. Once on some calm crest where
mountain kissed sky, one of those blissful moments came over him when
he felt himself so small, so great, so alone, so companioned,—inwardly
seized by the miracle and mystery of life surrounding him, pervading him,
at once bowing him down and lifting him up. Now all this is changed.
Now he hears voices, loud, raucous, zealous, parading their wisdom as
regards this august wealth of God. They speak, these voices, so wisely and
cleverly, concerning that which no man’s wisdom and sagacity has ever
plumbed. They out-trump each other with their oceanic learnedness. But
once yet again let the soul take a deep breath, and cry, “I am a man, not a
scholar. I dare to be a man, not a knower, the masters of the school
smother and deaden me with their science of the sublime and free world
of the deep and the divine and the eternal,”—let the soul that “thought”
has kept from <em>seeing</em> and <em>hearing</em> and <em>feeling</em>, so cry, and how childish, how
ridiculously petty, how weak and pathological, will all schoolmasterism
come to seem!
</p>

<p>
Nature is also <em>Art</em>, genuine, true art. It is an inner nature, a soul-nature,
a soul-life. This art-life which gushes forth like a spring from
secret depths, this enraptures the heart glowing with Dionysiac enthusiasm,
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
and steals over men like sweet images of a dream, which will not
fade even from his waking soul. Then it sings in us in a wonderful way,
in an unheard-of manner,—in jubilant bliss, aye, in heartbreaking lamentations,
longing for death! Life smites the strings of our soul, life itself,
and makes them resound in secret and hidden depths. It is this rich, overflowing
life which mirrors all its colorful magnificence in the soul, and
reveals to us its height and depth in dazzling light or midnight darkness.
</p>

<p>
But even here, here most of all perhaps, even out of this art men
have made a “school” and a schoolmasterism. Men try to measure according
to rules—measure what most of all mocks rules. Rules for poetry,
rules for song, rules for color, for light and shade, rules for the creation
(copying?) of pencil and brush and chisel and square, rules, rules, ever
rules—until one would think that art was for the sake of the rules of the
school, and not <em>vice versa</em>. There was a time—and for the matter of that,
there still is—when the born master had a slim chance and short shrift
among the “learned” masters. Who did not know a “school” by whose
name he could proudly name himself, thus guaranteeing his art to be artistic;
who beheld the world with his own free eyes, unfitted with spectacles
by some one of the “masters”; who with listening soul eavesdropped life,
asking never what was “written in the law” of art’s scribes and pharisees
upon the subject, let him set his house in order, for he must die
and not live, at least he must be cast out of the synagogue, excluded from
the artists’ guild, he must expect the “masters” to pounce upon him—at
least with the hoary weapons of obloquy and ridicule and ostracism and
starvation—until all the joy has gone out of his life. <em>Vers libre</em>—did not,
does not, the “master” antecedently and dogmatically know how “rotten”
that is? Ah, but what if that attitude of the finishedness and finality of
art, especially in its form, should replace art and artists with schools and
scholars? Are we to have only “masters” of schools, or also <em>Masters</em>
who belong to no school, and who cannot be tagged as scholars of another
“master.”
</p>

<p>
Nature, life, this is also <em>religion</em>, genuine, true religion at least. We
have not created it in us yet—this overpowering longing and striving to
surrender ourselves to another, a higher. To be sure, we have received
it as a heritage from our mother. At first a flood of love and longing
flowed through our souls from her eyes and heart. But her gift to us was
in turn a gift to her. In that gift all love’s beams focused, gathered
together, from all the ends of the earth and the eternities. In that gift
all life was wedded to the waking spirit—all life, sleeping and dreaming,
found its existence. And as this life awoke in us, we called it “inspiration,”
we felt that a Stronger had come upon us, against which we
could do nothing; we called it happiness, heart, love, God—the name was
noise and sound—and yet it was all feeling, veiled in heavenly glow.
</p>

<p>
Then the name became everything. On this name scribes exercised
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
their wits. They wrote it in their books and taught it in their schools.
Then the schoolmasters became the lords of faith. What was once original
life was now to be taught and learned—forgetting that while the psychology,
or history, or philosophy of religion can be taught, <em>religion</em> cannot
be, any more than you can teach grass to grow, or flowers to bloom, or
birds to sing, or lovers to love. So, religion came to be a thing of grades,
like the “grades” of a school—the more grades, the more religion! At
last the scholar in turn becomes a master! Verily, nowhere in the world has
schoolmasterism done so much harm as in religion. No scoff of the scoffer,
and no sword of the executioner, has dealt so deep and deadly wounds
upon the religious life, as has the folly of the wise and the understanding
who press their school knowledge and their school system upon men as
religious faith, and so overspin the entrance to the garden of the heart with
their spider-webs that no one can find the path any more to its bloom
and fragrance.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, objections to all this bristle. Is not the blessing of the
school—so this or that objector might urge—so manifest that, on account
of the blessing, all its evils might be very well put up with? The school
makes the unintelligible intelligible. The school widens the bed of the
spiritual life, so that its stream no longer devastatingly overflows its banks.
The school builds canals everywhere, that the watering of the land of
the human may be as extensive as possible, and the spirit of life be universally
fertilized with the achievements of civilization and culture. We
may thank our schools that all the world today has learned to read and
write. And, for him who can read and write, the way is open to all
the treasures of the human spirit—and where is there a civilization that
equals ours in the effort to provide schools corresponding to all the spheres
of life? Ought we not to bless such effort, promote and support it, with all
the means in our power?
</p>

<p>
Now, looking upon life more seriously and profoundly, we shall not
be able to show that the censor of these schools is entirely in the wrong,
when he declares that the spirit is perverted and corrupted by them. School
is model, is a uniform of the spirit which all individuals are to don and
wear. Hence as this school business spreads there is a dying-out of
spiritual originality, a monotony of manufactured personality.
</p>

<p>
Everything that belongs to the average is best conserved by school. The
most proper average man is always the best scholar. But all that is
above or below the average—this is often the best in a man—decays and
finds no nourishment. We have but to look at the whole state of our literature
in this country, to see what has become of the art of writing, of
authorship, in an age bursting with pride over everybody’s being able
to read and write. All the nameless insipidity and thoughtlessness written
and printed today, all the mendacity and perversity of feeling, which in
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
novels find their way into hut and salon alike might be happily spared
us did not everybody think he could read, and especially write! There is
no denying it, a serious question stares at us in the name of the school today.
This question is above all questions of school-reform, which seem so important
to us, for the improved, nay, the best school remains just—school!
And something of schoolmasterism and scholasticism cleaves to school!
And therefore Nietzsche was its so bitter foe because he would have <em>men</em>,
men who spoke and thought and felt powerfully and not as the scribes!
Nietzsche was its foe because he would have among men, personalities, individualities,
diversities, not uniformity and identity of spiritual life.
</p>

<p>
If, now, we have rightly comprehended the force of this censure against
the school and its master, we are already in the way to overcome and to
heal this school malady. The malady does not inhere in the school as
such, but in the false evaluation which we of today attribute to it, and in
the dominion which the school exercises over human spirits, by virtue of
this false appraisal. We think we can read if we have learned to read
in school. But this learning to read has yet to begin! Whoever does
not begin it his own self, will never truly learn it at all. We call our
schools educational institutions and yet they are altogether <em>imitational</em>
institutions, <em>after</em> which the true human education first begins. We do not
think of this, that this man whose knowledge still tastes of his school,
whose art shows his school, is still stuck in his school, and has not made
proper use of his school—which is to apply it; especially to overcome it!
Or, rather we think still less! We rest on the laurels of our school, and
if we won them we think that we have carried off the warrior’s prize
of life. But it is <em>our</em> fault, not the school’s, if the school narrows rather
than broadens our vision; if it binds us to its rules instead of releasing
us from them. Where are the men who still learn after school, nay, who
first begin then to learn what after all is the main thing of all learning—how
they can become greater, freer men, independent personalities? How
does it come that all stirring and moving of the modern spirit is at the
same time an insurrection against some kind of school? How does it come
that all creative, path-breaking spirits can begin to create, to live, only when
they have snapped the fetters of some school? And how does it come that
great discoveries of unknown islands of the human have never been made
within, but only without, the schools? Most of all, how does it come
that a Christ can speak with power only when he has learned not to speak
as the scribes and schoolmasters? The answer in every case is that we
are accustomed to expect of the school what, according to its very nature,
it cannot do, namely: to give life, to create life. Therefore, it is all-important
that we keep the path open, wide open, to the fountain of life in the
abyss of the human heart, in the unfathomableness of the world, so that
we too may learn to speak with power and not as the scribes; so that
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
our schools may not be diseases to be overcome, for many never overcome
during an entire life—but a staff with which we may learn to walk
until we shall need staff no more, because our feet have grown strong
to bear us on our way during the brief years of our pilgrimage.

With some apprehension I looked forward to Mr. Powys’s book of
“Literary Devotions,”<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a> for I had the good luck of listening to his lectures.
They are unforgettable, those bewitched moments in the darkened Little
Theater, where we sat hypnotized by “the galvanized demi-god vibrating in
the green light of the stage,” invoking the spirits of the Great. How will
those invocations appear, I worried, when congealed in the static book-form,
minus the catacomb-atmosphere, minus the serpent-like, mesmerizing cant of
the meteoric sorcerer, minus Raymond Johnson’s light-effects? “And, ah!
sweet, tender reader,” to use Mr. Powys’s style, my fears came true: the
book is a libretto, sans orchestra, sans singer. I know that many of the
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
lecturer’s devotees, especially the worshipping young ladies, will find little
difficulty in mentally supplying the libretto with the dynamic personality of
the performer; but my imagination is dewinged at the sight of the motionless
symmetric lines, and I fail to vocalize the legions of exclamation-marks,
the innumerable capital-letters, the profuse superlatives. With a kaleidoscopic
velocity the author displays his personal reflections upon the greatest minds
of the world; he bends them, he liquifies them, he moulds them, recreates
them according to his whim—good, bravissimo! I am the last person to
depreciate subjective criticism; I am tolerant enough to digest even such a
statement as that Goethe was typically and intrinsically German, or that
Nietzsche was thoroughly Christian. It is not Mr. Powys’s What that
nauseates me, but his How, his butaforial Grand Style, his monotonous
tremolo, his constant air of discovering new planets, his Pateresque worship
of beauty which lacks Pater’s aristocratic calm and reservedness, his
Oscaresque paradoxicalness deprived of Wilde’s chiselled wit, his continuous
ruminating of a limited stock of long, high words, of dizzying adjectives, of
saccharine adverbs.

<em>And Pippa Dances</em>
</h4>

<p class="noindent">
Yet there are some who complain about the lack of musical devotion
among Americans. Nay, music is getting absolutely too popular—witness
the crowded concert-halls, especially the ten-cent-Sunday-concerts arranged
by philanthropists for the uplift of the masses. It is significant to observe
that the so-called Submerged have learned not only to applaud, but also to
hiss, not only to accept with gratitude any sort of “divine” music, but to
demand a certain kind of music. And, surely, they well know what they want.
</p>

<p>
Hauptmann’s Huhn, the personification of the mob, wants the fragile
Pippa, the symbol of beauty, to dance for him. She is forced to obey, and
is of course crushed to death. And Pippa dances. That omnipotent Huhn
who can call down all the muses to come and entertain him, to amuse him,
to serve him, to degenerate or to perish! Watch that wonderful creature,
the amalgamated American Huhn, making love to music, hugging and
caressing her; I shudder at the thought of what will become of gentle Pippa
in the choking embrace of her boorish suitor.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Huhn knows what he wants. He expects of music the same service
that he gets from illustrations in popular magazine novels. He comes into
an ice-cream parlor and orders Banana-Split plus <em>William Tell</em> on the
victrola—so digestible and understandable. Last Sunday I observed a crowd
at a ten-cent concert enjoying the <em>Meditation</em>, good-humoredly assisting the
soloist by humming and whistling the familiar tune, their faces expressing
the satisfaction of victors. And the night before I witnessed the thousands
at Orchestra Hall, the Huhns in sweaters and in décolleté-gowns and in
dress-suits, going mad over that vulgarity, Mr. Carpenter’s precise reproduction
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
of barking dogs and of a policeman’s heavy walk. Huhn demands
music which he is capable of interpreting in every-day terms, which transparently
reflects his little emotions, his petty joys, his sirupy sorrows, his
after-meal dreams. Is it to be wondered that Huhn hisses and grumbles
when the conductor hesitatingly smuggles in such a risky novelty as Scriabin’s
<em>Prometheus</em>? What is to Huhn the Poem in Fire, the emerging of a dazed
humanity out of Chaos, the collision of gloom and light, the birth of the
Winged Man? What is Hecuba to him! And since Pippa must dance, the
obliging conductor hastens to appease the growling Huhn by the taffy of
Bruch’s concerto.
</p>

<p>
In recent years some inspired rebels among painters and sculptors have
striven towards the elevating of their arts to the highest level, that of music,
the noblest medium for the expression of aesthetic emotions, nobler than
words or brush or chisel. Recall Kandinsky’s color-symphonies. Alas, music
is not any longer a daughter of Olympus; she has been dragged by Huhn
from the pure atmosphere of the mountain summit down into the damp
valley. Wagner began the prostitution of music by making it subservient to
words; he has won the sanction and acclamation of the crowd. Then followed
the orgy of Program-music, those wood-cut illustrations, those rich gravies
that were invented to sweeten Mr. Huhn’s meals. Now an enterprising
Chicago merchant, Mr. Carpenter, has presented us with an apotheosis of
vulgarity to the hilarious triumph of the appreciative crowd, to the delight
of our “independent” music-critics—“that strange creature, the American
music-critic,” to quote a naive English journal.

That is why Gabrilowitsch’s playing of the piano on March 21 was
two different kinds of revelation to two different kinds of people. To a
great many it was a rich fulfillment of promise; to a few it was the end of
something that had had a great beginning.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that there’s a new standard to reckon with. We used to
argue that what a man had to say was more important than the way he
said it. Then we reversed that, claiming that a man may say anything
provided he say it well. Then the socialistic school tried to go back to the
first premise, but what they were really groping for was the new standard—which
is simply this: A man may still say anything he wishes and if
he says it well it will be art—<em>provided he really has something to say</em>.
Tennyson knew how to say things well, but he missed being an artist because
he had nothing to say. On what basis do we establish such a criterion?
Not merely on that of “ideas,” because you may have no ideas at all and
yet have profound reactions; and not merely on that of “socialism” or sincerity
or ideals; and not—oh well, I mean to get through this discussion
without dragging in the artist’s alleged monopoly of the eternal verities.
B. Russell Herts got very close to what I mean when he said that Arnold
Bennett missed real bigness because he had only a great and mighty skill
without having a great and mighty soul.
</p>

<p>
Well—you can’t make Art, we think now, unless you belong in the
great-and-mighty-soul class. And what does that mean, exactly? Perhaps
the whole thing can be explained under the term “enlarged consciousness.”
I wish Dora Marsden would discuss it in one of those clear-headed articles
she writes for <em>The Egoist</em>. The confusion in all our discussions of matter
and manner, of subject and form, of what determines genius, has come
about in two main ways: first, because we have made Taste a synonym
for Art—so that if we like Beethoven or Mozart we don’t accept Wagner
or Max Reger, or if we like classic rules we call romanticism “bad art”;
and second, because we have decided who had great and mighty souls on
an ethical basis. We said that Browning and Tennyson had them—chiefly
because they talked a great deal about God, I suppose; which only shows
how confusing it is to judge that way; it leaves no room for the distinction
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
that Browning had and Tennyson hadn’t. It’s all as silly as insisting that the
cubists ought to be considered great if they are sincere. Grant that they are.
To be sincere is easy; to say what you believe is simple; but to believe
something worth saying is the test of an art. Sincere stupid people are as
bad as any other stupid ones—and more boring.
</p>

<p>
I don’t know what else to say about it; but I know you can recognize
that “enlarged consciousness” in the first bars of a pianist’s playing, or in a
singer’s beginning of a song. Paderewski has it to such a degree that he
can play wrong notes and it doesn’t matter; and Duse has it, and Kreisler,
and Isadora Duncan, and Ludwig Wüllner, who breaks your heart with his
songs though he hasn’t even a singing voice. And the disappointment in
Gabrilowitsch is that he hasn’t.
</p>

<p>
I went to hear him play Chopin and Schumann with positive excitement.
Godowsky, with all his perfectly worked-out theories, always leaves
me with the feeling that he would be an artist if he weren’t an empty shell;
and Bauer, with all his beautiful work, leaves me with a sense of how he
<em>might</em> play if a fire could be started inside him. I expected that fire in
Gabrilowitsch—partly because I heard him play ten years ago and partly,
I suppose, because he is Russian. But the ten years have left him unstirred.
It’s as though the man in him had stood curiously still; as though life had
passed him. He is like a poet who has somehow escaped unhurt; or a
technician who perfects his expression and then wonders what he shall
express. As for his form, he does many exquisite things; for instance,
his <em>Des Abends</em>, which was extremely poetic and which seems to be the
type of thing he likes to play most. And he played the D Flat Prelude with
an exquisite perspective—and then a Chopin Waltz without any perspective
at all. Technically his worst feature is his chord-work—Bauer’s chords
sound like an organ in comparison. But Bauer knows how to touch the
piano for deep, “dark” effects, and Gabrilowitsch appears to like “bright”
sounds. He takes his chords with a high, tight wrist and brings them out
by pounding. These things are not done any more; the piano has shown
new tone-capacities since a few of the moderns abandoned, or modified,
what is supposed to be the “straight” Letschitizky method.
</p>

<p>
Well, all this wouldn’t matter so much if Gabrilowitsch had the ultimate
inspiration.... Somehow I keep feeling that the world is waiting
for its next great pianist.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="BAUERANDCASALS">
<span class="smallcaps">Bauer and Casals</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Two sorts of listeners heard the second Bauer-Casals recital at Orchestra
Hall: Those who love great music and those who love to babble about
great music. Intermediate classes of the mildly interested, the botching
amateurs, the self-adoring students, et al., stayed away, for Beethoven, Mendelssohn,
and Cesar Franck, in sonata form, have nothing for them. Would
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
that the critics and the exuberant school-girls might forever remain away
on such occasions, and choose for their frothing something less than the best.
</p>

<p>
Beethoven was not “dry” for a moment. One suspects that this composer
is perpetually slandered by the “traditional” handling of zealous academics;
for Bauer and Casals, with their wonted beauty of piano- and
violoncello-playing, made his music warm and pleasantly expansive, with no
sacrifice of dignity. He sounded almost romantic in the best sense of the
word. This was an experience. And Mendelssohn—what is more truly
elegant than his musical grace, or more delightful than his delicate humour—a
playfulness so seldom discovered by performers! Humour that becomes
subtler than a horse-laugh is beyond the ken of “professional” musicians,
although first-rank composers never lack a refined sense of fun, a keen
relish for jollity, for all that it may be in ethereal realms. In Cesar Franck
there is perhaps the very sublimate of humour, the mystic smile of faith.
One cannot escape a feeling of the deeply religious in this French master.
A new word should be coined to designate his music; it might be formed
by transposing the “passionate” of passionate love and the “fervent” of
fervent piety, and by some such amalgamation of cool, impersonal, austere
love with deepest faith become sensuous, impassioned, and lovely, the characterizing
word is secured. Franck’s music, surcharged with intense experience,
renders unnecessary any apology for this left-handed use of English.
It is but poorly spoken of in orthodox terms, since it embodies strange blendings
of emotion, both common and uncommon—emotions unified and crystallized
into the expression of a genius. Cesar Franck’s love, apparently,
flowed as readily and as warmly toward God as toward ravishing, although
possibly abstract, woman.
</p>

<p>
This is doubtless a considerable, if not impossible, reach for the imagination
of the patiently-groping reader, but it would have been less difficult
with Bauer and Casals for interpreters. The ’cellist’s playing was at once
sane and poetic, clean-cut and well-rounded; it was chaste without chill,
voluptuous without a debauch. And Bauer, master-pianist indeed, as his
press-agent styles him, brought from the piano more than enough kinds of
tone to shame the monochromatic theory about the restricted nature of the
piano. The most individual feature of his art is the production of solemn,
organ-like chords in the lower register—chords wonderfully sonorous and
rich, powerful enough to obliterate the memory of bedlam. Who cares if
he smudges a “run?” This god can sound chords. He redeems a host of
piano-jolters.

AUTUMNAL GORKY
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Tales of Two Countries, by Maxim Gorky.</em> [<em>B. W. Huebsch,
New York.</em>]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">G</span><span class="postfirstchar">orky’s</span> genius was meteoric. It flashed in the nineties for a brief
period with an extraordinary brilliance, illuminating a theretofore unknown
world of “has beens,” of Nietzschean <em>Bosyaki</em>. Gorky’s genius, we may say,
was elemental and local; it revealed a great spontaneous force on the part
of the writer in a peculiar atmosphere, on “the bottom” of life, in the realm
of care-free vagabonds. As soon as Gorky trespassed his circle he fell into
the pit of mediocrity and began to produce second rate plays, sermon-novels,
political sketches, and similar writings that may serve as excellent material
for the propaganda-lecturer. The present volume may be looked upon as
Gorky’s swan-song, if we consider his ill health; in fact he outlived himself
long ago as an artist, and in these <em>Tales</em> we witness the hectic flush of the
autumn of his career. The exotic beauty of Italy appears under the pen
of the Capri invalid in a morbid, consumptive aspect; the author is too self-conscious,
too much aware of the fact of his moribund existence to see the
intrinsic in life. The tendency to preach socialism further augments his
artistic daltonism, which is particularly evident in the <em>Russian Tales</em>. The
doomed man casts a weary glance over his distant native land, and he sees
there nothing but dismal black, hopeless pettiness and retrogression. The
satire is blunt and fails the mark; the allegories are of the vulgar, wood-cut
variety. Gorky has been dead for many years.

<em>Plaster Saints, by Israel Zangwill.</em> [<em>The Macmillan Company,

</p>

<p class="noindent">
The old situation: A revered priest, saint abroad, sinner at home; the
old sin—adultery; the old moral about casting the first stone. What is new
is the clergyman’s point of view that a “plaster saint” has no right to preach
righteousness, that only one who has gone through temptation, sin, and contrition
may be fit for the post of God’s shepherd.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
A sea captain who has never made a voyage—the perfection of ignorance—and
you trust him with the ship. You take a youth—the fool of the family for
choice—keep him in cotton-wool under a glass case, cram him with Greek and
Latin, constrict his neck with a white choker, clap a shovel hat on his sconce,
and lo! he is God’s minister!
</p>

<p>
... When I look at my old sermons, I blush at the impudence and ignorance

sinfulness.

It is all very well, if we grant that society is still in need of sermons on
chastity, if the Hebraic ideal of monogamy is still the most important problem
in the life of a community, to be discussed and advocated from the pulpit,
while ignoring the economic and social complexities of the present age. But
can we grant this anachronism? Is it not high time to follow the policy of
<em>laisser faire</em> in regard to individual morals? Mr. Zangwill appears in the
unenvious position of one quixotically breaking into an open door; yet he has
been accused of possessing a sense of humor.

MAGAZINE VERSE
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Anthology of Magazine Verse, 1914; selected and published by
William S. Braithwaite.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The proper way to review this collection of verse would be, no doubt,
to quote some of the best and some of the worst, make a learned and perfectly
empty comment upon so-and-so, and say that the book was better or
worse than last year’s compilation. But Mr. Braithwaite has sifted and re-sifted
the entire crop of poems until there is in his book nothing but the
best, such as it is. And the general trend of the volume is scarcely a matter
for enthusiasm. A fair conclusion must be that magazine editors were frequently
hard pressed for copy. As a faithful and stupidly patriotic American,
one should ponder long over certain attempts to found new “American”
verse-forms; but it is to be regretted, possibly, that the most enjoyable
poems in the collection are written upon foreign or mediaeval topics. As a
true aesthete, one ought to reek with admiration for nameless or badly-labelled
sonnets that, for some reason, fail to delight. And, as an exponent
of politico-poetic modernity, there should be wild raving over the “radical”
art of formless form; but this also is shamefully wanting in one’s reaction
to this anthology. A number of intelligent humans have been observed in
their expectant approach to this collection; they closed the book with neither
smiles nor frowns. It is difficult to forget that good poetry will bear re-reading,
or prove its worth by clinging to the memory; and it is still more
difficult to remember that art has only to be new, rude, or extreme to be
called wonderful. Why is this?

John Cowper Powys on Henry James
</h2>

</div>

<p class="subt">
(<em>Some more jottings from one of Mr. Powys’s lectures.</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">enry</span> James is a revealer of secrets, but never does he entirely draw the veil.
He has the most reluctance, the most reverence of all the great novelists. He is
always reluctant to draw the last veil. This great, plump-handed moribund figure,
waits—afraid. All of his work is a mirror—never a softening or blurring of outlines,
but a medium through which one sees the world as he sees it. In reading his works
one never forgets the author. All his people speak in his character. All is attuned
to his tone from beginning to end.
</p>

<p>
He uses slang with a curious kind of condescension,—all kinds of slang,—with a
tacit implicit apology to the reader. So fine a spirit—he is not at home with slang.
</p>

<p>
His work divides itself into three periods—best between 1900 and 1903. In reading
him approximate 1900 as the climacteric period.
</p>

<p>
His character delineation is superb. Ralph in <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, is the type
of those who have difficulty in asserting themselves and are in a peculiar way hurt
by contact with the world. Osborne—in the same book—is one of those peculiarly
hard, selfish, artistic, super-refined people who turn into ice whatever they touch.
He personifies the cruelty of a certain type of egoism—the immorality of laying a
dead hand upon life. Poe has that tendency to lay a dead hand upon what he cares
for and stop it from changing. Who of us with artistic sensibilities is not afflicted
with this immorality? This is the unpardonable sin—more than lust—more than passion—a
“necrophilism,” to lay the dead hand of eternal possession upon a young head.
</p>

<p>
Nothing exists but civilization for H. J. There has been no such writer since
Vergil. And for him (H. J.) there is but one civilization—European. He is the
cosmopolitan novelist. He describes Paris as no Frenchman does! Not only Paris,
but America, Italy, anywhere the reader falls into a delicious passivity to the synthesis
of nations. He knows them all and is at home in all. He is the novelist of society.
Society—which is the one grand outrage; it is not pain—it is not pity; it is society
which is the outrage upon personality, the permanent insult, the punishment to life.
As ordinary people we hate it often—as philosophers and artists we are bitter against
it, as hermits we are simply on the rack. But it is through their little conventionalities
that H. J. discovers people, human beings, in society. He uses these conventionalities
to portray his characters. He hears paeans of liberation, hells of pity and
sorrow, and distress as people signal to one another across these little conventionalities.
He fills the social atmosphere with rumors and whispers of people toward
one another.
</p>

<p>
In describing city and country he is equally great. He does not paint with words,
but simply transports you there. Read <em>The Ambassadors</em> for French scenery! Everything
is treated sacramentally. He is the Walter Pater of novelists with an Epicurean
sense for little things—for little things that happen every day.
</p>

<p>
There is another element in his work that is psychic and beyond—magnetic and
beyond. His people are held together by its vibrations. Read <em>The Two Magics</em>.
</p>

<p>
H. J. is the apostle to the rich. Money! that accursed thing! He understands
its importance. It lends itself in every direction to the tragedy of being. He understands
the art of the kind of life in which one can do what one wants. He understands
the rich American gentleman in Europe—touches his natural chastity, his goodness,
the single-hearted crystalline depths of his purity. Read <em>The Reverberator</em>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
In the <em>Two Hemispheres</em> we find a unique type of woman—a lady from the top of
her shining head to the tips of her little feet—exquisite, and yet an adventuress.
</p>

<p>
This noble, distinguished, massive intelligence is extraordinarily refined and yet
has a mania for reality. He risks the verge of vulgarity and never falls into it.
He redeems the commonplace.
</p>

<p>
To appreciate the mise en scène of his books—his descriptions of homes—read
<em>The Great Good Place</em>. He has a profound bitterness for stupid people. He understands
amorous, vampirish women who destroy a man’s work. Go to H. J. for artist
characters—for the baffled atrophied artists who have souls but will never do anything.
</p>

<p>
Read <em>The Tragic Muse</em>. Note the character of Gabriel Nash, who is Whistler, Oscar,
Pater all together and something added—the arch ghost—the moth of the cult of art.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of H. J. says that he might have been the cruelest and is the
tenderest of human beings. To him no one is so poor, so unwanted a spirit but
could fill a place that archangels might strive for. James is a Sennacherib of Assyria,
a Solomon, a pasha before whom ivory-browed vassals prostrate themselves. He is
the Solomon to whom many Queens of Sheba have come and been rejected, the lover
of chastity, of purity in the natural state.
</p>

<p>
He is difficult to read, this grand, massive, unflinching, shrewd old realist, because
of his intellect—a distinguished, tender, subtle spirit like a plant. And in the end I
sometimes wonder whether H. J. himself in imagination does not stroll beyond the
garden gate up the little hill and over to the churchyard, where, under the dank earth
he knows that the changing lineaments mold themselves into the sardonic grin of
humanity.

<p>
I have just read your article on Mrs. Ellis’s lecture, and I wish to congratulate
you upon its sentiments. Although I did not hear Mrs. Ellis, some of my friends did,
and their report quite agrees with your judgment.
</p>

<p>
I must confess I did not expect much from her to begin with. From interviews
and quotations it seemed clear that she was simply one who had never faced realities
frankly. Besides, her rather mawkish “religiousness” betrayed a mind unfitted to deal
adequately with such a problem.
</p>

<p>
I wish also to congratulate you upon your recognition of the genuine worth of
Emma Goldman. I had thought you were in danger of making a fetich of her, but
this article shows that you appreciate the things for which she stands.
</p>

<p>
I cannot believe that the superiority of Emma Goldman to such people as Mrs.
Ellis—I mean in the discernment of real values—is due to a difference of psychology,
or rather of temperament, but rather to the difference of point of view from which
Miss Goldman has seen the problems of human life. Her experience as a protagonist
of Labor in its struggle for freedom from exploitation has been a vital factor, I
think, in her development.

</p>

<p>
Some time ago a friend of yours, and mine, under guise of a Yuletide remembrance,
innocently and unapprehensive of the consequences no doubt, presented me
with a year’s subscription to the magazine which you purport to edit. Our mutual
acquaintance made some point of the fact that you were, as I aspire to be, a Truth-Seeker,
and also alluded, in passing, to a feminine pulchritude which you possessed,
not ordinarily a concomitant of an intellectual curiosity sufficiently keen to delve to the
bottom of things material and spiritual. I therefore looked forward with undeniable
expectation to a gratification of an insatiable desire to view the remains of many
idols and statues still unbroken, which have been laboriously erected by the prejudice,
credulity and ignorance of mankind for eons. Permit me to apprise you of my keen
disappointment in perusing what I have found ensconced between the covers of your
magazine.
</p>

<p>
I was given to understand that you were a quasi-missionary, in the most elastic
sense of that word, and as one who is sincerely trying to fathom your mission, if
one you have, I am writing to ascertain what it may be, because, owing either to an
utter failure of a somewhat impoverished sense of humor or a too ordinary quantum
of common sense, I seem to miss what you are driving at. If your magazine is designed
to interest a coterie of semi-crazed, halfbaked, “fin de siècle” ideologists, I
would appreciate a recognition of your object. To be quite frank with you, however,
I do not yet consider myself in the proper frame of mind to be classified in that
category of readers without demur. I am only a humble Searcher for the Truth in
Life in all its phases and being congenitally opposed to the baleful spreading of
“Buschwa,” I seem to find my mental equipoise disturbed by an attempt to diagnose
by any rational standard most of the alleged literary ebullitions which find place in
your <span class="smallcaps">Review</span>.
</p>

<p>
If we were still living in the Stone Age and reading matter of any sort were
still a scarce article, it might be necessary to put up with the poetical balderdash
which you publish. But having the daily newspapers to contend with and other pernicious
thiefs of valuable time, it seems a heinous offense to a perfectly respectable
mind to offer it, the unripe or overripe, mayhap, products of insane mentalities.
</p>

<p>
No doubt the fault is entirely that of an unschooled intellect, but at that, I have
to take my mind as it is. Just as it is unable to fathom this Christian Science drivel,
in that same measure does it utterly fail to be touched by what has appeared in <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> of the past four months.
</p>

<p>
Let me assure you that I have made an honest effort to understand your viewpoint.
Unless, however, I am cleared up as to what your aim and goal may be, I am compelled,
in self defense, to request you to kindly discontinue sending your magazine
to me. It may deflour my joy of life and ruin a saving and virtuous sense of the
funny. You are too kindhearted, I am sure, as our mutual acquaintance informs me,
to be an accessory before the fact to such an ungracious crime.

Your article on Mrs. Havelock Ellis was wonderful! Mrs. Ellis failed here
... just as in Chicago. I admire the clear and concise way in which you illumined
the reason of her failure.
</p>

<p>
There is so much work to be done it seems wicked that a woman, to whom the
world is so ready and willing to listen, who has the gift of poetic expression and direct
logical thinking, should waste her powers. It is as though she held understanding and
wisdom in her hands—tightly clenched—then when she should hold out those gifts to
the world, she opened wide her fingers ... here a flash—there a glimmer!—And
all vanishes!

<em>E. C. A. Smith, Grosse Ile, Michigan</em>:
</p>

<p>
I was delighted with your critique on Mrs. Ellis, not that I feel she fell as short
as you seem to think, but because your own article made a beginning on things which
must be said. I also emphatically endorse your views on enabling the poor to restrict
their birthrate, not on sentimental grounds, but because I know by experience it
would be a wise economy for the state. It is natural for wholesome people to want
children; the rise in the labor market caused by the dropping off in production by
the cowardly and incompetent would be amply compensated by the reduction in the
ranks of economically valueless dependents. It would take less, per capita, to support
orphan and insane asylums, dispensaries, and jails—not to speak of the wasteful drain
of unestimated sporadic charity. The contention that it would contribute to immorality
is absolutely absurd to anyone who has tried rescue work—girls have child after
child, undeterred by pain or shame, just as the mentally deficient in other lines injure
themselves in their frenzies.
</p>

<p>
The only way one has a right to judge life is to look at it from the inside. Before
I read Havelock Ellis I was unable to take this view of the subjects you so sanely
and clearly project on our imaginations. After laying down his book I found my only
shock came from some of the methods employed in “curing” these unfortunates. From
the histories of cases he cites, I should consider it fair to conclude that the nervous
organization of inverts tended to average below par—as is the usual medical view.
This may be a psychic, not physical, result. Personally, I cannot see any effect the
reading of that material has had on me except to make me more wisely charitable in
my views. It has broadened my ideals, without weakening them. It has put a new
value on normality. It has not modified my personal theory of love any more than
the not-entirely aesthetic conditions of carrying and bearing my children did. There
are points about that sort of experience—especially the attitude of the inexperienced—which
makes the prude’s attitude to the whole broad question ridiculous. Another
generation will regard ours as we do the Victorians—my shade will grind its spirit
teeth to hear them laugh.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure your point of view as a writer rather than a speaker does not make
you overlook legitimate limitations in Mrs. Ellis’s position. A speaker can often
suggest far more than she actually utters; the conclusions people are inspired to make
for themselves are of far greater value than if they were cast forth with inspired
eloquence. To antagonize an audience by forcing your point is to lose efficiency. In
print one has not the personal element so strongly and immediately to consider. Perhaps
she was subtler than Emma Goldman, but not so much weaker as you think.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is the most satisfactory source of mental stimulation I have
yet discovered. If I do not always agree with it I at least have the sense of arguing
with a friend whose intellect I respect—never did I feel that for any other publication.
And I love freshness and freedom and enthusiasm as I love youth itself—they’re the
qualities that promise growth.

Your review of Mr. Powys’s lectures have carried me back four years into a period
when I was studying music in New York with a Norwegian singer, and she and I
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
listened to him at the Brooklyn Institute week by week! Never will I forget it. And
she—well, she is a genius herself, an interpreter of Norwegian folk songs—and Powys
lit her soul until it flamed forth like a beacon! If you heard his Shelley, I think you
saw the veritable incarnation of that transcendent spirit....
</p>

<p>
Then I listened to him again in Buffalo, last year, on Keats. And the audience,
mostly women (God forgive them!) seemed like school children—no, I will not confound
such innocent souls with the inert mass that confronted him! And this is our
culture!
</p>

<p>
I think the spirit of your magazine is to other magazines what Powys is to other
lecturers. He makes you forget that he is such. You become part of his theme, or is
it, <em>himself</em>? And so it is I seem both to lose and find myself when I read the pages
of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.

By Compton Mackenzie
</p>

<p>
The story of Michael Fane, Oxford graduate, and his experiences
in London’s moral bypaths. Readers of “Carnival” found in the
author an artist who was as original as he was unusual, and in
this new story by the same author will be found a strong study
of a man worth knowing.

“It is just the book for those who have reached the age to appreciate
the god whom we do not know until we have ourselves
lost him forever—the divinity of youth.”—Truth.
</p>

<p>
“The author not only visualizes for us, he creates the very air
and smell of the underworld, and above all he shows us more
clearly than anyone else has done that the lives of the people
generally classed as criminals not only negative our morality, but
create a morality of their own which is, in its own sphere, as
negative as our own.”—T. P.’s Weekly.

Young Earnest
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Gilbert Cannan
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cannan’s new novel is a revelation in the art of character
delineation. It is the story of a young man in search of himself
and his place in the scheme of things. A search in which his
days are filled with intimate experiences with life in all its
kaleidoscopic coloring and variation. It is the kind of book one
likes to read slowly, for every page is full of charm, insight and
wisdom.
</p>

<p>
“A fine imaginative insight and an honest facing of reality and
its problems combine to give unusual distinction to “Young
Earnest.”—The Chicago Evening Post.
</p>

<p>
“Full of admirable observation, clearness of vision, subtle interpretation.
A work women should read, for they will learn
much about the other sex, reputed easy to understand.”—The
English Review.
</p>

<p>
“Mr. Cannan is a master in the art of dissecting human emotion.”—The
New York Times.

The Promise of<br />
A Better Tire Day
</p>

<p>
Goodyear Fortified Tires came, years ago, to promise men a better
tire day. And that promise was fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
They made Goodyear the largest-selling tire in the world, a place it
has held ever since. Last year men bought 1,479,883—about one
for each car in use.
</p>

<p class="h2 adh">
Not Magical
</p>

<p>
Don’t expect in the Goodyear
a magical tire. It is not exempt
from mishap and misuse.
</p>

<p>
It won top place because it
averaged best. It did that because,
in five great ways, it excels
every other tire. It combats
in five ways, exclusive to Goodyear,
these six major troubles—
</p>

<p class="c u">
<b>Rim-Cuts</b><br />
<b>Blowouts</b><br />
<b>Loose Treads</b><br />
<b>Insecurity</b><br />
<b>Punctures</b><br />
<b>Skidding</b>
</p>

<p>
One way—our “On-Air”
cure—costs us
$450,000 yearly. One
comes through forming
in each tire hundreds of
large rubber rivets. One
compels us to vulcanize
in each tire base 126
braided piano wires.
</p>

<p>
One comes through our double-thick
All-Weather tread, with its
sharp, tough, resistless grips.
These things together mean a
super-tire.
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
Lower Prices
</p>

<p>
Yet these costly-built tires, in
the past two years, have been
thrice reduced in price. Our last
reduction—on February 1st—brings
the two-year total to
45%.
</p>

<p>
Never has a tire given
so much for the money
as Fortified Tires do
now. We ask you, for
your own sake, to prove
it. Any dealer will supply
you.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
